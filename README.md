# tabletstand
draw a SVG that can be printed and cut out to make a tablet stand

Needs drawSVG (https://github.com/cduck/drawSvg)

first pass; I did all of this in jupyter, so I'll command-line it for the next pass
TODO: command-line arguments for the size of the card going through the printer, whether to print the instructions on the card or not, output to PDF or SVG (but default to SVG)
